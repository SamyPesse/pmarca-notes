Tonight I'm tickled pink to be able to talk about [our new investment](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/11/technology/a-move-to-go-beyond-lists-for-content-at-buzzfeed.html?smid=tw-share) in Buzzfeed!

My partner [Chris Dixon](https://twitter.com/cdixon) discusses our new investment in Buzzfeed here: [http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/](http://cdixon.org/2014/08/10/buzzfeed/)

> We think of BuzzFeed as a technology company. They embrace Internet culture. Everything is first optimized for mobile and social.

> BuzzFeed has technology at its core. Its 100+ person tech team has created world-class systems... Engineers are first class citizens.

And then on top of its technology core, Buzzfeed's reporting team is now routinely committing breathtaking investigative journalism... Examples:

* @maxseddon at the Malaysian airlines crash site in Ukraine: http://www.buzzfeed.com/maxseddon/chaos-at-malaysian-airlines-crash-site-leaves-victims-by-the
* @mike_giglio's war reporting from Syria: http://www.buzzfeed.com/mikegiglio/inside-syria-al-qaeda-was-here
* @itsjina's amazing story of Rwandan women flexing their political muscles: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jinamoore/how-rwandan-women-got-their-power
* @jlfeder on how Vladimir Putin uses anti-gay policies as a geopolitical strategy: http://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/russia-exports-homosexual-propaganda-law-in-effort-to-fight
* @AramRoston on how the US covertly arms its proxies around the world: http://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/how-a-one-time-pig-peddler-helped-the-us-flood-war-zones-wit

We think the opportunity in front of @peretti, @BuzzFeedBen, @zefrank, and their colleagues is effectively unbounded.
We are very excited to work with everyone at Buzzfeed to help them realize their dreams of a profoundly important new media institution.
