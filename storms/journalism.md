# Golden Age of Journalism

Something I believe that a lot of people I know believe: We live in **Golden Age of journalism** as measured by quality of top contributors.

I've collected 238 members of the press I most respect into this Twitter list: https://twitter.com/pmarca/press/members -- It's a joy to read every day!

As I've discussed before[^1]: Great unexpected side effect of Internet = best journalists have far broader reach now.

I can't resist singling out some who fall into category of "drop everything I'm doing to read anything they write" -- out of many.

* **Politics**: @MarkHalperin, @jheil, @MarkLeibovich, @nickconfessore, @harrispolitico -- it's routinely amazing how deep they go.
* **Economics**: @worstall explains the world we live in better than anyone; joined by @greg_ip and @Neil_Irwin for deep dives into macro econ.
Financial crisis made clear quality of reporting by @andrewrsorkin, @KateKellyCNBC, @GZuckerman, @bethanymac12, and @BoydRoddy.
At intersection of finance & economics, the ongoing work by @TMFHousel and @matt_levine is truly extraordinary & deeply insightful.
