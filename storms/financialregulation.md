# Financial Regulation

*Published on Twitter, [August 7, 2014](https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/497254813139091457)*

Lessons learned by managers and shareholders of large regulated financial institutions for the next financial crisis:

* There is no risk of individual executive criminal prosecution whatsoever.
* Bailouts are guaranteed, particularly for bondholders, for all but the weakest members of the herd.
* The one thing that will get punished is acceding to the government's request/demand for stronger companies to buy weaker companies.
* Ultimate fines will be levied against your shareholder base 8 years in the future, not your shareholder base when the sins are committed.
* "Too big to fail" institutions will be allowed to become bigger than ever, increasing their safety buffer for next time.
    * For bonus points, regulatory barriers against new competition will be raised, not lowered, further entrenching incumbents.
    * "Too big to jail" is real, [according to the Attorney General of the United States](http://www.americanbanker.com/issues/178_45/transcript-attorney-general-eric-holder-on-too-big-to-jail-1057295-1.html).
    * Regulators on whose watch the last crisis happened, will be allowed to become even bigger and more powerful.
    *All three gov't branches -- executive, legislative, and judicial -- are out to lunch on oversight.
