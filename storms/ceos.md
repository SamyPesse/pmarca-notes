# The truly great tech CEOs

In tech, we talk about difference between **technical-founder/CEO** (product/eng background) vs **professional CEO** (sales/marketing background).

Our general theory is: Easier to teach product innovator how to manage, than it is to teach sales/marketing operator how to innovate.
There are many exceptions in both directions, of course. Mountain is hard to climb either way. Lots of work/learning/adaptation required.
I propose another lens on dynamic: Difference between knowing What & Who, vs knowing How, Where, & When. Bear with me...

Great tech founder/CEOs tend to focus on What & Who: What product to build, and Who to hire/train/retain/motivate to build it.

Great pro CEOs tend to focus on How, Where, & When: How = processes; Where = geographic expansion; When = optimizing business across time.

To succeed at scale, each needs to learn the other skills & hire people who have them:
* Founder/CEO -> How/Where/When
* Pro CEO -> What/Who

**The challenge:** Usually easier to hire skilled business professionals who know How/Where/When than What/Who. Fishing from unbalanced pool.

**The trap:** Only nailing What/Who can carry startup a long way, but only nailing How/Where/When = slow road to zombieland and company death.

Ultimately = team-building for both paths. But dynamic different & differently challenging in each direction; requires open discussion.

**Addendum:** The Why = the mission. Ideally beyond just "the company's success". Increasingly important for all paths.
**Addendum:** The truly great tech CEOs have mastered all of these: What, Who, How, Where, & When... and Why.
