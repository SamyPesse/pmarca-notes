### What is a tweetstorm?

A Twitterstorm is a sudden spike in activity surrounding a certain topic on the Twitter social media site.

A Twitterstorm is often started by a single person who sends his or her followers a message often related to breaking news or a controversial debate. Using a certain and often original hashtag, the tweet quickly spreads as people are notified of the message and then reuse the hashtag with subsequent retweets and tweets.
